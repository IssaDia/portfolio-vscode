## Goal

Have fun reproducing something I use almost everyday and show some of my skills in Frontend development.

## Methodology

I saw this kind of Vscode reproduction online and studied how it was structured. Then I took my actual Vscode as a model to reproduce it.

## Built With

- Next.js - The React framework for production.
- TypeScript - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- ESLint - The pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX.
  
## Development Environment

- Editor: VSCode
- OS: MacOS
- Package Manager: NPM
- API Testing: Postman
- Version Control: Git
  
## Why These Technologies?

I chose React

Technical Watch

- [Grafikart's tutorial for window resizing in JS] (https://youtu.be/JV7M9utl5QQ?si=535yJ8EQra6JjoCs)

## Challenges

- set up functions to color different text depending on style of each extension
- find the good way to resize a window 

## Getting Started


## Prerequisites

Node.js v14.17.2 or higher
NPM v6.14.15 or higher

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

### Clone the repository

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

### üì• Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Start the development server

```
npm run dev
```

## Environment Configuration
Create a .env.local file in the root of your project and fill the file with informations : 

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_USERNAME=
NEXT_GITHUB_API_KEY=
NEXT_RESEND_API_KEY=
NEXT_PERSONAL_EMAIL=
```

## Future Improvements


- add new functionnalities to look more like a vscode interface
- improve styling color text depending on extension
- implement comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- optimize performance and accessibility.
